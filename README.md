Whenever I come across good blogs, it's either from a post someone shared on a social media platform or when I get a direct forward from a friend, which happens not so often.

Pilgrim, like the tagline suggests, is a place to awaken your curiosity across various directions. The idea is to share 6 interesting articles every week as part of a newsletter to the people who subscribe.
